# Maritime MaaS
Django application that acts as an integration layer that mediates the connection between ticket sales platforms and MaaS providers.

## Development with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)

Prerequisites:
* Docker
* Docker Compose

1. Create a `docker-compose.env.yaml` file in the project folder:
   * Use `docker-compose.env.yaml.example` as a base, it does not need any changes for getting the project running.
   * Set entrypoint/startup variables according to taste.
     * `DEBUG`, controls debug mode on/off
     * `APPLY_MIGRATIONS`, applies migrations on startup
     * `CREATE_DJANGO_SUPERUSER`, creates an admin user with credentials `kuva-admin`:(password, see below)
     (kuva-admin@hel.ninja)
     * `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`, the admin user's password. If this is not given, a random password is generated
     and written into stdout when an admin user is created automatically.

2. Run `docker-compose up`
    * The project is now running at [localhost:8081](http://localhost:8081)

**Optional steps**

1. Run migrations:
    * Taken care by the example env
    * `docker exec maritime-maas-backend python manage.py migrate`

2. Create superuser:
    * Taken care by the example env
    * `docker exec -it maritime-maas-backend python manage.py createsuperuser`


## Development without Docker

Prerequisites:
* PostgreSQL 11
* Python 3.8


### Installing Python requirements

* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` (development requirements)


### Database

To setup a database compatible with default database settings:

Create user and database

    sudo -u postgres createuser -P -R -S maritime_maas  # use password `maritime_maas`
    sudo -u postgres createdb -O maritime_maas maritime_maas

Allow user to create test database

    sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER USER maritime_maas CREATEDB;"


### Daily running

* Create `.env` file: `touch .env`
* Set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `1`.
* Run `python manage.py migrate`
* Run `python manage.py createsuperuser`
* Run `python manage.py runserver 0:8000`

The project is now running at [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)


## Keeping Python requirements up to date

1. Install `pip-tools`:
    * `pip install pip-tools`

2. Add new packages to `requirements.in` or `requirements-dev.in`

3. Update `.txt` file for the changed requirements file:
    * `pip-compile requirements.in`
    * `pip-compile requirements-dev.in`

4. If you want to update dependencies to their newest versions, run:
    * `pip-compile --upgrade requirements.in`

5. To install Python requirements run:
    * `pip-sync requirements.txt`


## Code format

This project uses
[`black`](https://github.com/ambv/black),
[`flake8`](https://gitlab.com/pycqa/flake8) and
[`isort`](https://github.com/timothycrosley/isort)
for code formatting and quality checking. Project follows the basic
black config, without any modifications.

Basic `black` commands:

* To let `black` do its magic: `black .`
* To see which files `black` would change: `black --check .`

[`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com/) can be used to install and
run all the formatting tools as git hooks automatically before a
commit.


## Running tests

* Set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `1`.
* Run `pytest`.
